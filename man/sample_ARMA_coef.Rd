sample_ARMA_coef(
  order = c(0L, 0L),

\arguments{
\item{order}{A specification of the non-seasonal part of the ARIMA model:
this is different than the \code{order} input of \code{\link[stats:arima]{stats::arima()}}, because
the degree of differencing is not included. Thus order is a vector of
length two of the form \eqn{(p, q)}.}

\item{seasonal}{A specification of the seasonal part of the ARIMA model. Can
be either a vector of length 2, or a list with an \code{order} component; if
a list, a period can be included, but it does not affect the function
output.}

\item{n}{An integer indicating how many sets of ARMA coefficients should be
sampled.}

\item{Mod_bounds}{Bounds on the magnitude of the roots.}
}
\value{
a vector of randomly sampled ARMA coefficients.
}
\description{
This function randomly samples the ARMA coefficients of a specified
ARMA model. The coefficients are sampled so that the resulting ARMA model
is both causal and invertible.
}
\details{
For an ARMA model to be causal and invertible, the roots of the AR and MA
polynomials must lie outside the the complex unit circle. The AR and MA
polynomials are defined as:
\deqn{\phi(z) = 1 - \phi_1 z - \phi_2 z^2 - \ldots - \phi_p z^p}
\deqn{\theta(z) = 1 + \theta_1 z + \theta_2 z^2 + \ldots + \theta_q z^q}
where \eqn{z} is a complex number, \eqn{\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_p} are the
\eqn{p} AR coefficients of the ARMA model, and
\eqn{\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_p} are the \eqn{q} MA coefficients of the ARMA
model.

ARMA coefficients are sampled by sampling inverse roots to be inside the
complex unit circle, and then calculating the resulting polynomial.
To ensure that the resulting polynomial coefficients are real, we only sample
half of the needed number of complex roots, and set the remaining half to be
the complex conjugate of the sampled points. In the case where the number of
coefficients is odd, the first coefficient is sampled as a real number
between 0-1, the remaining roots are sampled as described, and then the
resulting polynomial is checked to ensure all roots lie outside the unit
circle; if not, we resample the coefficients.
