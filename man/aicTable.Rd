\title{ARIMA AIC table}
\usage{
aicTable(data, P, Q, D = 0, max_iters = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a time series object, or a dataset that can be used as input into
the \link{arima} function.}

\item{P}{a positive integer value representing the maximum number of AR
coefficients that should be included in the table.}

\item{Q}{a positive integer value representing the maximum number of MA
coefficients that should be included in the table.}

\item{D}{a positive integer value representing the degree of differencing
to be used for each \eqn{ARMA(p, q)} model.}

\item{max_iters}{Maximum number of restarts for the \link{arima} function.}
}
\description{
Construct table of AIC for all combinations 0<=p<=P and 0<=q<=Q
}
\details{
This function creates an AIC table for ARMA models of varying sizes.
Each row for the table corresponds to a different AR value, and each column
of the table corresponds to a different MA value.

\examples{
aicTable(presidents, 3, 2)
