## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have: 

* Added a link to an ArXiv paper that describes the method implemented in this 
  package. 
* Added parenthesis behind all function names in the description text 
  (e.g. arima --> arima()).

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note
