    heavily on the source code from the stats package, which was made by the 
    R Core team. In particular, all non-binary files in the src directory were 
    created or based on code from the stats package. Because this package 
    contains small modifications to the C code for the arima function, 
    it was necessary to copy or modify each of these files.")

Description: This package provides tools for estimating and analyzing auto 
    regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. The primary function 
    in this package is 'arima', which fits an ARIMA model to univariate time 
    series data using a random restart algorithm. This approach generally leads 
    to improved model fits in the sense that the resulting models will have a 
    model likelihood greater or equal to that of the likelihood obtained by 
    fitting the same model using the 'arima' function from the 'stats' package. 
    This package enables proper optimization of model likelihoods, which is a 
    necessary condition for performing likelihood ratio tests.
