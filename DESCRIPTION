Description: This package provides additional useful interfaces for ARIMA, 
  and more generally, time series modeling in R. One important function in 
  this package is arima2, which fits an ARIMA model to univariate time series
  data using a random restart algorithm. This approach generally leads to
  improved model fits in the sense that the resulting models will have a model
  likelihood greater or equal to that of the likelihood obtained by fitting the 
  same model using the function.
